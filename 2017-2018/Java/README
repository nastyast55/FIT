Application for creating, editing, saving and loading simple block diagrams with arithmetic 
operations, with possibility to make a calculation after making (loading) the schema.

Used technology: Java 8, JavaFX, IntelliJ IDEA, JUnit, SchemeBuilder

**Description:
1. Basic description:
	- the application will allow to create, edit, save, and load block diagrams
	- the created diagrams can be saved and loaded later
	- the scheme is composed of blocks and interconnections between blocks
2. Blocks:
	- each block has defined input and output ports

	- each port is connected to a type that is represented as a set of data 
	  pairs Name-> value; the value will always be double

	- the blocks can be connected only between the input and output port

	- each block contains a calculation (formulas) that transform values from 
	  input ports to output port values

	- Block operations (kinds of blocks): 
		➢ blockAdd - operation add
		➢ blockDec - operation decrement
		➢ blockInc - operation increment
		➢ blockSub - operation substruct
		➢ blockMul - operation multiply
		➢ blockDiv - operation divide
		➢ blockMod - operation modulo
		➢ blockPow - operation power
		➢ blockNot - operation negation
		➢ blockValue - input point of a scheme (input value)
	- Data types:
		➢ double
		➢ complex numbers 
		(for complex numbers it is possible only 4 operations: add, substruct, multiply 
		and divide)
	
3. Connection between blocks:
	- data type is assigned automatically by associated interconnects ports
	- should be the same data type for the whole schema

4. Calculation
	- After creating (or loading) the schema, it is posiible to make a calculation
	- After loading diagram, it is possible to continue create loaded diagram and then 
	  make a calculation
	- Input values and their types will be filled in the "start" blocks - block VAL

5. Other:
	- Move the mouse over the each block to see the current status of the data, 
	  or connection line between blocks.

Running application: IntelliJ IDEA
