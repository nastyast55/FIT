A Shell script analyzes directories and as output gives information about root directory, numbers of subdirectories and information about files (file extensions and calculated for every extension the size of largest file and average) in analyzed directory.

Usage: dirstat [-i FILE_ERE] [DIR]
Description: 
1. DIR - analyzed directory. If DIR is not specified, the actual directory will be analyzed.
2. Option -i causes files and directories to be ignored, whose name matches the extended regular expression FILE_ERE.     
   FILE_ERE must not cover the name of the root directory.
